Php Developer (Laravel ,CI, PostGis)
Kathmandu, Bāgmatī, Nepal
Summary
Namastey and Hello Guys, 
It’s me Rabi Gorkhali born on 1994 September 18 in the historically
enriched place of Bhaktapur, Nepal. I always wanted to be a
detective which was inspired by one of my favourite films. But
the fortune took me to another way, to the journey of Information
Technology. I have completed my Diploma in Engineering in IT in
2014 A.D. and Bachelor Honors in IT in 2018 A.D. I started working
as a software developer in 2017 and currently working at Ekbana
Solution.  
Since childhood, I was very open minded and was less
overprotected by parents. I still remember roaming the whole day
with friends when i was 5-6 years old. I guess other children wouldn’t
go out without the permission of their parents. Because of this I
got huge opportunities to learn and earn people beyond my school
friends. I was one of the active students in school like engaging in
dancing, sports, and other curriculum activities. Since childhood
I always go on evening walks which makes me feel fresh and
happening...
Though I love exploring and social life, I am really shy in nature and
less talkative. I always wanted a break after some periods of working
life. A phase of my life came  where I was able to manage my travel
cost, and the desire of exploring new places, love towards nature led
me to trek and travel to different parts of Nepal. I began to travel 3
times a year taking a break from work and study. And I will keep on
traveling till my legs are with me.  
Beyond study, travel, family and work, I am a social worker as well.
It’s been more than 7 years contributing my time and effort for the
sake of community, peace and humanity through the Rotaract Club
of Bhaktapur. Rotaract has really brought a big positive effect in my
life. It gave me opportunities to utilize my spare time for good things,
earned me a huge group of nice people, taught me to become a
leader, taught me to learn from failure and success. It really helped
  Page 1 of 3   
my life to be surrounded by positive energies. I am always committed
to all aspects of my life and I believe life is better when all these
things are balanced. 
Anyways thanks for visiting my profile, visit my website
www.rabigorkhai.com.np and hope may be you will find some
information you needed and yeah keep in touch.
